# SweSAT-1.0: A Benchmark for Swedish LLMs

SweSAT-1.0 is a benchmark dataset created from the Swedish university entrance exam (*Högskoleprovet*) to assess large language models (LLMs) in Swedish. It includes **867 multiple-choice questions** from the last 8 exams (2020-10-25 to 2024-04-13), covering  the following six different question types:

- **ORD** (Vocabulary) - Tests the understanding of in-domain words and synonyms.
- **LÄS** (Reading Comprehension) - Assesses the ability to make inferences from a text.
- **MEK** (Sentence Completion) - Evaluates the ability to complete sentences via cloze tests.
- **XYZ** (Mathematical Problem-Solving) - Includes questions on arithmetic, algebra, geometry, statistics, and functions.
- **KVA** (Quantitative Comparisons) - Measures the ability to compare quantities in mathematical concepts.
- **NOG** (Data Sufficiency) - Determines the ability to assess whether given data is sufficient to solve a problem.

## Install dependencies

- **With [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended):**

    ```shell
    uv sync
    uv run python script_name.py
    ```

- **With `pip`:**

    ```shell
    python -m venv .swe_sat_venv
    source .swe_sat_venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -e .
    ```

## Dataset

The Swe-SAT-1.0 dataset is partially available [exams](exams) with the exception of reading passages for the LÄS section. To obtain the full dataset including the LÄS section, run the following script:

```shell
python3 process_verbal_sections/get_pdfs.py
```

After running this script, a newly created directory `exam_pdfs` will be populated. Now, run the script to process the verbal sections.
  
```shell
python3 process_verbal_sections/parse_exam_pdf.py exam_pdfs
```

> [!TIP]  
> The LÄS section may contain copyrighted reading passages. You can inspect the sources of these passages on [studera.nu](https://www.studera.nu/hogskoleprov/forbered/tidigare-hogskoleprov/) when clicking on a specific exam year (found under the *"Källor"* section). :warning: The site is in Swedish!
